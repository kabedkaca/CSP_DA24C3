raw data from kaggle

1) 1st data cleaning (2/6/2024)

format date and time,one with general,and one with specific

then change all features except sub-meter-3 to float, as even in numerical,there are dtype as object

use unique to see,what problem making them dtype as object eventho they are in numerical

use replace method, to replace the unique object to NaN

then all features except time and date are fill with mean

no null

proceed with EDA

but problem arise when to modelling, 



2) 2nd data cleaning (5/6/2024)

raw data
combine date and time,and then format to datetime, drop original date time column,bring to the front
do the same to all ind features, replace with NaN, fill with mean

use EDA to see correlation
try to connect
active_power and intensity has corr = 1,
drop intensity

set DateTime as index, for time series


3) 3rd data cleaning 6/6/2024

save cleaned dataset for modelling
new notebook for modelling
DateTime as index
Drop all columns except global active power(usage)

plot data to see the trend or seasonal
check for stationary (ADF)
ACF ,Pacf plot
split to TTS
start model
prediction on test set
evaluate using metric and plotting
