raw data from kaggle

1st data cleaning (2/6/2024)

format date and time,one with normal,and one with specific

then change all features except sub-meter-3 to float, as even in numerical,there are dtype as object

use unique to see,what problem making them dtype as object eventho they are in numerical

use replace method, to replace the unique object to NaN

then all features except time and date are fill with mean

no null

proceed with EDA

but problem arise when to modelling



2ND data cleaning (5/6/2024)

raw data
combine date and time,and then format to datetime, drop original date time column,bring to the front
do the same to all ind features, replace with NaN, fill with mean

use EDA to see correlation
try to connect
active_power and intensity has corr = 1,
drop intensity

set DateTime as index, for time series
