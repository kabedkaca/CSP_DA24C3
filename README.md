Capstone project: Time-Series Analysis on household power consumption prediction using ARIMA & SARIMA prediction model.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/vedumrajkar/electricity-consumption-time-series-analysis/notebook

This dataset contains six months of household electricity consumption data, gathered between January 2007 and June 2007

-----------------------------

Dataset information:

Date: The date of the observation. (Date)   -    
Time: The time of the observation. (Time)

- Global_active_power: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts). (Numeric)

- Global_reactive_power: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts). (Numeric)

- Voltage: The voltage at which the electricity is delivered to the household (volts). (Numeric)

- Global_intensity: The average current intensity delivered to the household (amps). (Numeric)
- Sub_metering_1: The active power consumed by the kitchen (kilowatts). (Numeric)

- Sub_metering_2: The active power consumed by the laundry room (kilowatts). (Numeric)

- Sub_metering_3: The active power consumed by the electric water heater and air conditioner (kilowatts). (Numeric)

Stages of project:

1) Understanding project

what is the topic: power consumption  
                     
what is the goal: predict power usage in next years to come

2)Understanding the data

Load the data, the info and the points for each features in the data

3)Data preparation

Dataset would be cleaned, organized and munging so that it suitable with the obejctive and analysis.

4)Data modelling

As the dataset has been cleaned and formatted to be appropriate for modelling, we will proceed with time-series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMA on the dataset.

5)Model Evaluation

As the dataset is trained and forecasting prediction on the test set, we will evaluate the model based on the error.

6)Deployment

The model will be deployed by presenting and demonstrating to the stakeholders.
