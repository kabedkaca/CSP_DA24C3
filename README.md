Work on simple capstone project on Time-Series theme on household power consumption prediction.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/vedumrajkar/electricity-consumption-time-series-analysis/notebook

This dataset contains six months of household electricity consumption data, gathered between January 2007 and June 2007

Date: The date of the observation. (Date)
Time: The time of the observation. (Time)

Global_active_power: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts). (Numeric)
Global_reactive_power: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts). (Numeric)

Voltage: The voltage at which the electricity is delivered to the household (volts). (Numeric)
Global_intensity: The average current intensity delivered to the household (amps). (Numeric)

Sub_metering_1: The active power consumed by the kitchen (kilowatts). (Numeric)
Sub_metering_2: The active power consumed by the laundry room (kilowatts). (Numeric)
Sub_metering_3: The active power consumed by the electric water heater and air conditioner (kilowatts). (Numeric)



1) Understanding project

what is the topic: power consumption
what is the goal: predict power usage in next years to come

2)Understanding the data

Load the data, the info and the points for each features in the data

3)Data preparation

Dataset would be cleaned,organized and munging so that it fit with the obejctive and analysis
